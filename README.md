- Generate analysis and visualizations of nutrition data, such as macronutrient breakdown, using Chart.js.

## Getting Started

**Note: Unfortunately, I can't deploy the server part and give access to the database, so you won't be able to start project, but you can contact me and we figure this out together**

1. Clone this and [SERVER](https://github.com/olehhasii/gym-api-nest.js) repository to your local machine using git clone.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install the dependencies using npm install for both the client and server folders.
4. Create a .env file in the server part, and set the required environment variables for MongoDB connection, and JWT secret.
5. Start the client `npm start` and server `npm run start:dev` concurrently in the root directory.
6. Access the web-app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
